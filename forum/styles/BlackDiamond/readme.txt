----   BlackDiamond style for phpBB3.0.0 Gold
----   Modified theme and imagesets from
----   original proSilver theme/style

Install:

Simply extract the .zip contents and upload to the /styles folder within your forum
via FTP. Log into admin control panel, select the 'styles' tab. The forum will
detect the inactive style and list it below the others. Simply activate the style.

The new style will be added to the active list. The 'Used by' list will still show
users using the original even if you set the new style as default. Setting default
does not seem to affect current members with a style already selected/active.
To force all users to use the new default style, simply deactivate the previously
used style (forcing all users to use the new default) and activate it again if you
wish to have the old style still available as an option.

Thats about it. Still waiting on some nifty images to replace the fugly ones.
Will update this style when they become availabe.

Enjoy!
